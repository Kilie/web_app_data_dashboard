## Web App: Data Dashboard
This repository contains back- and front-end files for building a web app for a data dashboard to show the land use of the top 10 world economies, including the change of arable land (hectares per person) from 1990 to 2015, the fertilizer consumption (kilograms per hectare of arable land) in 2015, the rural population (% of total population) in 2015, and the change in forest land (% of land area) from 1990 to 2015. 

The origincal data for these graphs was obtained from the World Bank Open Data API. 

## File Description
There are files for both the back-end and front-end as well as for deploying the web app to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

## Contribution
Anyone is very welcome to contribute to this repository by either adding more features to the front-end or adding more inspiring graphs to the dashboard et cetera.
